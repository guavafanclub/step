          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <h4>Crocheting</h4>
          <p>I began crocheting in highschool and have picked it back up in recent
              months. I've crocheted teddy bears, stuffed elephants, stuffed cats,
              and a hat. I've been crocheting a blanket for what feels like forever.

          <h4>Reading</h4>
          <p>I'm almost 99% sure my eyesight deteriorated because I used to read 
              books by moonlight when I was supposed to be sleeping. As I've grown 
              up, I've had less time to dedicate to reading, but I still try to fit a 
              book in here and there.<br><b>My favorite books:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>A Tale for the Time Being </i>by Ruth Ozeki</li>
              <li><i>The Giver </i>by Lois Lowry</li>
              <li><i>Gone Girl </i>by Gillian Flynn</li>

          <h4>Cooking</h4>
          <p>Despite my mom teaching me how to cook our cultural Liberian dishes
              since I was a preteen, I've only now begun to find joy in cooking.
              I like to make random dishes I find on the internet and Liberian
              dishes I grew up eating.</p>

          <h3>Interests</h3>
          <h4>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h4>
          <p>I'm really into the Avatar: The Last Airbender series right now. I
              watched it with my brother as a child, but forgot most of the story.
              Since it was recently added to Netflix, I've been rewatching Aang and
              his journey as avatar. My favorite character is Genreal Iroh. I love 
              hearing his little nuggets of wisdom throughout the series.</p>
