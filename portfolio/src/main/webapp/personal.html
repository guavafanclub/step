      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <h4>Crocheting</h4>
      <p> I began crocheting in highschool and have picked it back up in recent
        months. I've crocheted teddy bears, stuffed elephants, stuffed cats,
        and a hat. I've been crocheting a blanket for what feels like forever.
      </p>
      <h4>Reading</h4>
      <p>I'm almost 99% sure my eyesight deteriorated because I used to read 
        books by moonlight when I was supposed to be sleeping. As I've grown 
        up, I've had less time to dedicate to reading, but I still try to fit a 
        book in here and there.<br><b>My favorite books:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>A Tale for the Time Being </i>by Ruth Ozeki</li>
          <li><i>The Giver </i>by Lois Lowry</li>
          <li><i>Gone Girl </i>by Gillian Flynn</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Cooking</h4>
      <p>Despite my mom teaching me how to cook our cultural Liberian dishes
        since I was a preteen, I've only now begun to find joy in cooking.
        I like to make random dishes I find on the internet and Liberian
        dishes I grew up eating.</p>
